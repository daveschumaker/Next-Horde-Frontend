              2022.12.24 - Bulk downloads using the export option are a bit
              buggy. I believe this is due to browser and device memory
              limitations. I&apos;m investigating ways to make the downloads
              easier (perhaps breaking them up into a series of files that you
              would have to manually download). In the meantime, you can
              optionally download 100 images at a time on from the{' '}
              <Linker href="/images">images page</Linker> or groups of your
              favorite images. (I know that some of you have thousands of images
              and this is not ideal at the moment.)

            Fix: Image ratings have been inconsistent and broken since some
            griefing countermeasures were implemented on the backend. Ratings
            should now work properly again. Protip: If you see an image that
            literally says something like &quot;rate this image a 4&quot;, then
            please do that. It&quot;s a form of captcha to verify ratings.

            Feature: Swanky new image details page and modal. (And modal?). Yes!
            They are now basically the same thing. Same info available on both.
            Easier to update. Buttons with dropdown options, if needed. Can now
            view tileable images on the image details page. Can now view
            tileable images fullscreen! Will there be bugs? Probably! But
            that&apos;s what makes things fun. (But seriously, if you see any,

            Refactor the pending page... again. No front end changes as of yet,
            but tried to rewrite a whooooole bunch of stuff to make fetching
            requests more reliable and performant. Also implemented a
            virtualized window for lists (as dynamically rendering a list of
            hundred of changing items frequently caused memory errors and
            crashes in people&apos;s browsers). Still work to do. Thanks to
            Litnine for reporting some bugs with this page.

            from Litnine. You can now lock the aspect ratio when creating an
            image and resize to your heart&apos;s content! The new component
            will automatically calculate the proper corresponding size to the
            nearest 64 pixels. This has been on the to-do list for a long time

            -- this time refactoring some more of my spaghetti code to create
            some easily reusable components (specifically, the number input and
            slider components you see everywhere). I am in awe. Thank you! Also,
            they added a helpful UX feature that hides the face-fixer slider if

            Inspired by Litnine&apos;s PR, I added some similar improvements to
            the toggle switches and tooltip components. Again, nothing
            immediately obvious, but makes it easy to re-use these UI components
            in other places.

            Another upcoming update from ResidentChiefNZ will add more

            Speaking of inpainting -- previously, you had to jump through a
            bunch of annoying steps. They inpainting model wasn&apos;t visible
            in the models dropdown unless you first: uploaded an image, and then
            painted something. Only then could you select
            &quot;stable_diffusion_inpainting&quot;. You should now be able to
            select that (and any inpainting model) from the go. We make software
            that should be smart, so it should know if you need to add a source
            mask and warn you before continuing. Well... now it does!

            another performance issue where someone has 56K images they&apos;ve
            generated with ArtBot! So, I queued up something like 2,000 images
            and boy was the pending page slow. It crashed the tab in Chrome!

            I really, really, really fucked up image ratings. Awhile back
            (2023.01.28), I implemented a handy carousel component that slides
            in new images as you rate them. In my infinite wisdom, I forgot to
            update the image id that was sent to the rating API. Thus, as you
            rated images, your ratings were actually only being sent for
            whatever the first image that loaded on the rating page. db0, the
            Stable Horde creator, will have to delete nearly 338K suspect
            ratings from ArtBot. Ugggh. 😫

              Inpainting and img2img masking aren&apos;t exactly the same thing,
              though from an end-user perspective, they both work in a very
              similar fashion -- you paint a part of an image that you want
              changed, type in a description and voila! With inpainting, you are
              limited to a very specific model (stable_diffusion_inpainting,
              based on SD v2). With img2img mask, you can use any model. Also,
              due to how resource intensive inpainting is, there are not many
              workers currently running the stable_diffusion_inpainting model,
              which has resulted in a ton of issues on ArtBot (error messages
              saying: &quot;No workers available, try again later.&quot;).

              This is something I hadn&apos;t been doing before now. There are a

              of this writing!). And many of the models are being updated by
              their maintainers. Some models can drastically change output
              between differing versions, meaning that the same parameters and
              seed given to a different version of a particular model will
              result in a completely different image. In an effort to give more
              transparency into how your images have been created, ArtBot will

            Change model trigger behavior to default always adding trigger to

            <AddedInfo>
              Thoughts behind this: Stable Diffusion tends to place more
              emphasis on words at the beginning of a prompt. If you&apos;re
              using a custom model, you probably want to trigger its special
              behavior, so placing prompt at front seems to make the most sense.
              Should this actually be a personal preference / configuration
              option? Let me know.

            Refactor: Made some changes in model selection. Now, you can select
            any model available within the Stable Horde models database, even if
            0 workers are available. In theory (hopefully, maybe), this means
            that a worker running dynamic models will eventually load your
            requested model. I am not entirely convinced that this works yet.

            automatically have the same error state applied. This will prevent

              It&apos;s frustrating to have added all sorts of input for an

              something and then all the data is lost when you return. No more!
              Data is preserved if you move away from the create page. This
              state gets reset when you create a new image.

            Fix: I think I found the issue with the pesky &quot;90 per 1
            minute&quot; rate limiting error. A number of people open images up
            in new tabs. Each one of those tabs is firing off API calls to
            Stable Horde (especially if you are generating and checking a number
            of image requests). This makes it easy to inadvertently hit a rate
            limit and get unexplained errors. Now, API calls will only happen in
            the active browser tab. Things should be much smoother now. Thanks
            to &quot;webhead&quot; on Discord for helping me to track this down.

            Fix: Hide inpainting model from models dropdown in non inpainting

              Turn your cheesy drawings into awesome AI generated art. This is

            Show source image on details page if an image was generated via

            the original image.

            <AddedInfo>
              The thinking here is to simplify the front page as much as
              possible. If someone has no experience with generative AI art, let
              them quickly create something.

            Fixed: issue where choosing a model (e.g., stable_diffusion) would
            get saved as a variable for samplers, resulting in payload
            validation errors from the API. This is why testing your code is
            important. Ah hem.

              More workers generally means quicker generation times. This is

            <AddedInfo>
              Due to bandwidth constraints, the Stable Horde sends images as a
              WEBP file. This isn&apos;t always optimal for downloading to your
              local device. On each image details page, you will see a download
              button (down arrow).
